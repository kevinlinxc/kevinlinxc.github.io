  summary: OmenBot is a Discord.py bot that I made for use in my friends' voice calls. If you're unaware, Discord is a voice/text chat application. My bot is primarily a music bot, capable of playing audio from Youtube urls or Youtube search queries, pausing, stopping and resuming. Additionally, it plays some funny sound effects into voice calls and tells our friend George to do his homework. This isn't the same as the marketed and published Omen Bot, it's just the name I gave my personal bot.

  summary: Every year, Engineering Physics has a robot summer course where a robot is built to achieve a goal in a competition with classmates in teams of 4. Our cohort's competition was at home because of COVID-19, so we picked up electronics from the university and bought tools/materials to make our robot. I learned to design and solder circuits, write tape-following PID software in C++, use various sensors/motors, and construct a chassis using hot glue and plastic. Click for a YouTube video I made.

  summary: A machine learning/computer vision course competition (ENPH353). I implemented a convolutional neural net written in Python with TensorFlow to read license plates and used OpenCV for homographization of license plates, while my partner worked on navigation of the Gazebo course. We scored a perfect score on license plates and placed 5th out of 20 teams because our robot was slower than 4 other teams.

  repo: https://github.com/kevinlinxc/PlayBarnesBot
  summary: In the video game Hearthstone, there is a card named Barnes that summons other creatures. A content creator that I enjoy watching popularized the catchphrase "I play Barnes and I summon ___". I decided to make a Twitter bot that finishes the phrase in daily tweets using words from Google API, Cards Against Humanity cards, and some custom words. To automate the script to run daily, I learned to use Amazon Web Services (AWS).

  repo: https://github.com/kevinlinxc/AutoscrollSidekick
  summary: While learning to play the guitar, I was frustrated that the automatic scrolling of guitar tabs (sheet music) was locked behind a paywall on some popular websites and applications. Using the experience from my internship, I made my own app that could take pictures and scroll through them at a modifiable speed. After a year of leaving this project on the backburner, I completed it and published my app onto the Google Play Store.

  role: Creator
  timeline: "December 2019"
  summary: The tablet that I use to take notes came with a very small stylus, about the size of a Nintendo DS stylus. I decided I wanted to modify to be more ergonomic and easier to hold. I experimented with a few pen bodies, and then designed and 3D printed an insert that lets the stylus stick with the pen body and provide a comfortable grip.

  timeline: "July 2019"
  repo: https://github.com/kevinlinxc/NurseAnnieBot
  summary: Another content creator that I follow made a simple video game in which you have to recognize specific inputs and respond with your own keyboard inputs, a measure of reaction time. I used some basic computer vision to automate playing of the game as an exercise and a minor introduction to computer vision.

- name: Robotic Claw
  logo: images/projects/robotic arm.png
  role: Team Member
  timeline: "January 2019"
  summary: For my APSC 101 class, my team and I got to build a robotic claw using aluminum sheets, pop rivets, hobby sonar sensors, and Arduino software. The claw was designed and built over a month of work, and in the end it was capable of picking up 1-5Kg blocks, large scoops of pasta, and a really long stick. The claw uses the sonar sensor to detect when to open, and then releases again when it detects a bin to drop the contents into.
