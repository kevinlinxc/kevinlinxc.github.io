    <h3>UBC Engineering Physics | Year 3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Hi, my name is Kevin and I'm currently studying Engineering Physics at UBC. In my spare time, I make creative videos, take stock pictures, game with friends, play piano/guitar, and work on 
    personal coding projects. I am passionate about sustainability, innovation, and space exploration. In the future, I'm hoping to become a Sustainability or Aerospace Engineer, although I would be happy writing meaningful software for a company with a vision. All the big pictures on this site are taken by me. Check out my socials below or keep scrolling for more info on my hobbies and projects!&nbsp; </p>

      <p class="sectionContent"> OmenBot is a Discord.py bot that I made for use in my friends' voice calls. If you're unaware, Discord is a voice/text chat application. My bot is primarily a music bot, capable of playing audio from Youtube urls or Youtube search queries, pausing, stopping and resuming. Additionally, it plays some funny sound effects into voice calls and tells our friend George to do his homework. This isn't the same as the marketed and published <a href="https://top.gg/bot/718915731000918096">Omen Bot</a>, it's just the name I gave my personal bot.&nbsp;</p>

		<p class="sectionContent"> In the video game Hearthstone, there is a card named Barnes that summons other creatures. A content creator that I enjoy watching popularized the catchphrase "I play Barnes and I summon ___". I decided to make a Twitter bot that finishes the phrase in daily tweets using words from Google Trends, Cards Against Humanity cards, and some custom words. To automate the script to run daily, I learned to use Amazon Web Services (AWS).</p>

		<p class="sectionContent"> While learning to play the guitar, I was frustrated that the automatic scrolling of guitar tabs (sheet music) was locked behind a paywall on some popular websites and applications. Using the experience from my internship, I made my own app that could take pictures and scroll through them at a modifiable speed. After a year of leaving this project on the backburner, I completed it and published my app onto the Google Play Store. </p>

		<p class="sectionContent"> Another content creator that I follow made a simple video game in which you have to recognize specific inputs and respond with your own keyboard inputs. I used some basic computer vision to automate playing of the game as an exercise and a minor introduction to computer vision. I plan on attempting another computer vision project soon, since this project only had basic color matching. </p>

      <p class="sectionContent"> Every year, Engineering Physics has a robot summer course where a robot is built to achieve a goal in a competition with classmates in teams of 4. Our cohort's competition was at home because of COVID-19, so we picked up electronics from the university and bought tools/materials to make our robot. I learned to design and solder circuits, write tape-following PID software in C++, use various sensors/motors, and construct a chassis using hot glue and plastic.

		<p class="sectionContent"> The tablet that I use to take notes came with a very small stylus, about the size of a Nintendo DS stylus. I decided I wanted to modify to be more ergonomic and easier to hold. I experimented with a few pen bodies, and then designed and 3D printed an insert that lets the stylus stick with the pen body and provide a comfortable grip. I use it in class to take notes now. </p>

		<p class="sectionContent"> For my APSC 101 class, my team and I got to build a robotic claw using aluminum sheets, pop rivets, hobby sonar sensors, and Arduino software. The claw was designed and built over a month of work, and in the end it was capable of picking up 1-5Kg blocks, large scoops of pasta, and a really long stick. The claw uses the sonar sensor to detect when to open, and then releases again when it detects a bin to drop the contents into. </p>

      <p class="sectionContent"> Since 2018, I've self-studied and picked up motion graphics/editing and used it in around 70 gaming and comedy videos. A few videos have been especially successful, gaining over 50,000 views, and all my videos have collectively generated 20000 watch hours. Besides making the motion graphics and special effects for these videos, I've learned to make compelling thumbnails and market my videos online. I've also been commissioned to make stream highlight videos for King Nidhogg, and those videos have gained 143000 views to date.</p>

The pictures I take are mostly of nature, taken during hiking trips with my parents, but being a part of the engineering community at UBC also lets me take photos of cool projects and technology. All the pictures on this website are taken by me.   </p>

One of the events is a filmfest where each faculty of engineering (first years are their own group) submits a filmfest. In first year, I helped the first years get 1st place with some fancy effects, and in my second year, I filmed with Engineering Physics and edited the whole film and was rewarded with 2nd place. </p>
