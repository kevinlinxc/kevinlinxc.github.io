## Introduction

Bad Apple!! is a song with a black and white music video that has become notorious online as a funny thing to play on any kind of screen, like that of 
a fridge or a printer, or on an excel spreadsheet. The task of playing Bad Apple!! on anything possible is a fun cultural movement that often involves
engineering skills, and I wanted to add my own spin on it.

So, I decided I wanted to play Bad Apple!! using ... apples. I wanted to make a stop motion animation of the song, using apples as the pixels.
I thought about how I would do this for over a year, and I finally figured it all out in 2023. Real apples would be too big, so I decided to use 700+ plastic ones.

Here's the YouTube video with the final video and the explanation of all the engineering work that went into it:
