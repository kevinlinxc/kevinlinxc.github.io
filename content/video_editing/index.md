This page is my version of a video editing portfolio, an annotated showcase of some of my favourite work.

## 2024
In 2024, I spent 8 months working on a short film. It is by far the best vfx work I have ever done, easily 50 vfx shots, each with rotoscoping, compositing, and tracking. Give it a watch:

I made videos in 2023 but not many involved vfx.

## 2022

## Inspiration

The first video I ever made was actually in Grade 5, with help from my dad. Our class had a "challenge project" where
we could go above and beyond a normal assignment for extra credit. My dad, my friend and I visited a ghost town
in our province and recorded a whole tour with a cute storyline. Back at home, my dad helped us do add some simple graphics
and a voiceover in iMovie. I definitely owe my interest in filmmaking to him.

Another reason I got into video editing was this animation from "To This Day", a stand up poetry video about bullying.
I was shown this in Grade 8, and I was really impressed by how the creator had managed to create such a smooth,
aesthetically-pleasing animation.

Video editing to me has always been about creating impressive and valuable visuals
out of thin air, and this was my first exposure to something that made me want to create art.
