## Inspiration

The first video I ever made was actually in Grade 5, with help from my dad. Our class had a "challenge project" where
we could go above and beyond a normal assignment for extra credit. My dad, my friend and I visited a ghost town
in our province and recorded a whole tour with a cute storyline. Back at home, my dad helped us do add some simple graphics
and a voiceover in iMovie. I definitely owe my interest in filmmaking to him.

Another reason I got into video editing was this animation from "To This Day", a stand up poetry video about bullying.
I was shown this in Grade 8, and I was really impressed by how the creator had managed to create such a smooth,
aesthetically-pleasing animation.

Video editing to me has always been about creating impressive and valuable visuals
out of thin air, and this was my first exposure to something that made me want to create art.
