# QuickFormula
 Quickformula is a promising idea I have for a new project. My goal is to make
 the only site that we'll ever need to use for formulas.

 I want to make it take
 seconds to find the formula you know is out there on the internet, rather than a minute of scrolling through Google results, images, and textbooks.

 I've flip flopped on how to achieve this.  I started with a React implementation, switched to a Ruby on Rails after picking it up at Shopify, but both of those still had to steep a learning curve. For now, I think I'll make the website out of Python and Flask, using one of the many templates and plugins.

 I'll update this page once I make more progress - I'm very excited to work more on this.
