# stemformulas.com
 [stemformulas.com](https://stemformulas.com/) is a site that I developed (with a bit of help) and currently maintain.

 I want to make it take seconds to find the formula you know is out there on the internet, rather than a minute of scrolling through Google results, images, and textbooks.

 I flip flopped on how to achieve this.  I started with a React implementation, switched to a Ruby on Rails after picking it up at Shopify, but both of those still had to steep a learning curve. I briefly considered using Flask and Python, but finally I settled on Hugo and went all the way with it.

I'm so proud of what I made on stemformulas.com, it looks modern, it has so much room for people to contribute to, and it could really positively impact people's lives if it gets popular.

The technical portions of it were also so much fun to work on, because I've never really taken a dedicated course for web development; I learned HTML off the cuff very slowly, I learned some JavaScript in high school but never touched it again, and I learned CSS in hacky ways with a Python package called Streamlit, and the amalgamation of all of these small experiences led to me being just competent enough to make stemformulas.com and make it well.

Stemformulas.com also gave me valuable experience in branding, buying domains, setting up forms, all sorts of stuff. Projects are what lead to my ability to make stemformulas, and now it as a project has taught me so much. I hope people find it useful!
