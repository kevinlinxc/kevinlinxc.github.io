This week, I'm finally graduating from university (only took 6 yearsðŸ˜…). I have always found myself melancholy at graduation time, and I think a lot of people have probably felt this way too. Your life as you know it changes when you graduate, the routine you've built up for years is suddenly gone. It feels like you've lost a part of your life, even if you spent it well (or maybe especially if you spent it well).

I would sum this all up in one word: uncertainty. It's the uncertainty of what your life is going to be after an inflection point that feels the most daunting to me.

So what's the resolution to this? I think the resolution to the planning fallacy is a good place to start. The planning fallacy is the tendency for people to underestimate how long projects will take, and the common advice to resolve this is to look at how long previous, similar projects took. Thus I look at my life, and at my past graduations. **Every time I thought the best days were behind me, I was wrong**. I believe this time will be no different; I start my dream job in 2 weeks, and I'm working on a short film that really means something to me. Per aspera ad astra. Through hardships to the stars.
